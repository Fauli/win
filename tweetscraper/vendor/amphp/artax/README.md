# Artax HTTP Client

Artax is a full-featured HTTP/1.1 client as specified in RFC 2616. Its API is designed to simplify
standards-compliant HTTP resource traversal and RESTful web service consumption without obscuring the
underlying HTTP protocol. The code manually implements the HTTP over TCP sockets; as such it has no
dependency on PHP's `curl_*` API and requires no non-standard PHP extensions.

#### FEATURES

 - Eschews any cURL/libcurl dependency
 - Exposes APIs for synchronous, parallel and event-driven request/response
 - Retains persistent "keep-alive" connections
 - Transparently follows redirects
 - Requests and decodes gzipped entity bodies
 - Provides access to all raw request/response headers and message data
 - Streams request and response entity bodies for hands-on memory management
 - Supports all standard and custom request methods
 - Trivializes submitting HTTP forms for multipart and form-encoded entities via the `FormBody` API
 - Provides fully customizable and secure-by-default TLS (https://) support
 - Exposes a simple subject/observer API for plugins and extensions
 - Offers advanced connection limiting options on a per-host basis
 - Provides fully automatic cookie support via the Cookie extension
 - Offers built-in progress bar and tracking support via the Progress extension
 

#### PROJECT GOALS

* Model all code as closely as possible to the protocol outlined in [RFC 2616][rfc2616];
* Implement an HTTP/1.1 client built on raw sockets with no libcurl dependency;
* Build all components using [SOLID][solid], readable and thoroughly unit-tested code;

#### INSTALLATION

###### Git:

```bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/rdlowrey/Artax.git
```

Successful recursive clones will place the [Alert][alert-github] dependency in the `vendor/` 
directory. When included in your project the `autoload.php` script will register class autoloaders
for both `Artax` and `Alert` namespaces.

###### Composer:

```bash
$ php composer.phar require rdlowrey/Artax:0.6.*
```


#### REQUIREMENTS

* PHP 5.4+
* The [Alert][alert-github] library (installed automatically if you `git clone --recursive`)
* PHP's `openssl` extension if you need TLS (https://) encryption support
* PHP's `zlib` extension if you wish to request/decompress gzipped responses


#### SERIAL vs. ASYNC

Artax offers two APIs for your HTTP needs:

- **Serial:** `Artax\Client` is fully synchronous. You can requests invidual HTTP resources serially
or in parallel, but retrieval function calls are always synchronous.

- **Async:** `Artax\AsyncClient` is fully asynchronous and runs inside a non-blocking event loop.
The asynchronous client allows for full IO and computational parallelization. But with great power
comes great responsibility; an understanding of non-blocking IO is needed to effectively write code using
this paradigm.


#### BASIC USAGE

###### Simple GET Request

Often we only care about simple GET retrieval. For such cases Artax accepts a basic HTTP URI as the
request parameter:

```php
<?php

$client = new Artax\Client;
$response = $client->request('http://www.google.com');

echo "Response status code: ", $response->getStatus(), "\n";
echo "Response reason:      ", $response->getReason(), "\n";
echo "Response protocol:    ", $response->getProtocol(), "\n";

print_r($response->getAllHeaders());

echo $response->getBody();
```

###### Customized Request Message

For non-trivial requests Artax allows you to construct messages piece-by-piece. This example
sets the request method to POST and assigns an entity body. HTTP veterans will notice that
we don't bother to set a `Content-Length` or `Host` header. Aerys will automatically add/normalize
missing headers for us so we don't need to worry about it. The only property that _MUST_ be assigned
when sending an `Artax\Request` is the absolute *http://* or *https://* request URI:

```php
<?php

$client = new Artax\Client;
$request = new Artax\Request;
$request->setUri('http://httpbin.org/post');
$request->setProtocol('1.1');
$request->setMethod('POST');
$request->setAllHeaders([
    'Content-Type' => 'text/plain; charset=utf-8',
    'Cookie' => ['Cookie1=val1', 'Cookie2=val2']
]);
$request->setBody('woot!');

$response = $client->request($request);
```

In the above example the raw request message sent to the server will look like this:

```
POST /post HTTP/1.1
Host: httpbin.org
Content-Length: 5
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Cookie: Cookie1=val1
Cookie: Cookie2=val2

woot!
```

###### Form Submission

Assume that `httpbin.org/post` contains the following HTML form:

```html
<form action="http://httpbin.org/post" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
   <P>
   What is your name? <input type="text" name="name"><br>
   What files are you sending?<br>
   <input type="file" name="file1"><br>
   <input type="file" name="file2"><br>
   <input type="submit" value="Send">
 </form>
```

We can easily submit this form using the `Artax\FormBody` API:

```php
<?php

$body = new Artax\FormBody;

$body->addField('name', 'Zoroaster');
$body->addFileField('file1', '/hard/path/to/some/file1');
$body->addFileField('file2', '/hard/path/to/some/file2');

$client = new Artax\Client;
$request = new Artax\Request;
$request->setBody($body);
$request->setUri('http://httpbin.org/post');
$request->setMethod('POST');

$response = $client->request($request);
```

It's *important* to note that `Artax\FormBody` will **stream** any file fields you specify as
part of your form submission. This means you can easily upload huge files without issue.

###### Synchronous Parallel Requests

The synchronous `Artax\Client::requestMulti` retrieves multiple requests in parallel and alerts
the relevant callbacks each time a request in the batch completes:

```php
<?php

$client = new Artax\Client;

$onResponse = function($requestKey, Artax\Response $response) {
    echo 'Response: (', $requestKey, ') ', $response->getStatus(), "\n";
};
$onError = function($requestKey, Exception $error) {
    echo 'Error: (', $requestKey, ') ', $error->getMessage(), "\n";
};
$requests = [
    'google' => 'http://www.google.com',
    'google news' => 'http://news.google.com',
    'bing' => 'http://www.bing.com',
    'yahoo' => 'http://www.yahoo.com',
    'php' => 'http://www.php.net'
];

$client->requestMulti($requests, $onResponse, $onError);
```

Note that though the individual requests in the `$requests` batch are retrieved in parallel the
`Client::requestMulti` call itself will block until all of the requests complete (or error out).

#### WHAT'S WITH THE NAME?

Children of the 1980s are likely familiar with [The NeverEnding Story][neverending] and may remember
the scene where Atreyu's faithful steed, Artax, died in the Swamp of Sadness. The name is an homage.
