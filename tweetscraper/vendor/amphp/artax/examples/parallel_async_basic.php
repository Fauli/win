/**
 * The paradigm of event-driven parallelism is beyond the scope of this example but the main
 * takeaway for our purposes is that everything takes place inside a non-blocking event loop.
 * `Artax\AsyncClient` relies on the Amp library's event reactor to function. This example
 * demonstrates how to schedule and execute a set of parallel requests in the context of an
 * event loop. You'll notice that the individual responses return in a different order from that
 * in which they were originally requested.
