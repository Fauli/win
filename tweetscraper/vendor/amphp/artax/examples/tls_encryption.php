/**
 * For normal TLS-encrypted sites (https://) Artax will "just work" with the default settings. The
 * library uses the same certificate authority file as the Mozilla Foundation.
 * 
 * Artax uses PHP's SSL stream wrapper options to customize TLS connection settings. These options
 * may be modified as demonstrated here:
 * 
 *     $client->setOption('tlsOptions', [
 *         'verify_peer' => TRUE,
 *         'allow_self_signed' => FALSE,
 *         'cafile' => dirname(__DIR__) . '/certs/cacert.pem',
 *         'capath' => NULL,
 *         'local_cert' => NULL,
 *         'passphrase' => NULL,
 *         'CN_match' => NULL,
 *         'verify_depth' => NULL,
 *         'ciphers' => NULL,
 *         'SNI_enabled' => NULL,
 *         'SNI_server_name' => NULL
 *     ]);
 * 
 * Artax also ships with an executable file, bin/cert-updater.php that you can run periodically to
 * update your trusted certificate authorities. This file is generally updated every few months and
 * you should endeavor to keep yours current for maximum security.
