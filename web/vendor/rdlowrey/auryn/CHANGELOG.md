v0.14.0
================================================================================

- Renamed `Injector::getExecutable()` -> `Injector::buildExecutable()`
- Fix Issue #60: default value for compiled class ctor param not used in the
  absence of parameter definition.
- Use PSR-4 directory structure
- Other miscellaneous updates


v0.13.0
================================================================================

- Added `Injector::prepare()` method to allow custom mutators for setter
  injection (among other things) after object instantiation.
- Simplified directory structure, normalized source formatting/spacing

v0.12.0
================================================================================

- Significant internals simplification; all tests pass but may have unintended
  side-effects.
- Fixed bug where providing a shared class would fail.
- Improved test cases
- Miscellaneous formatting, documentation and cleanup
- Directory structure changes
- Exception messages are no longer public (constants) and are treated as an
  implementation detail.

v0.11.0
================================================================================

- Parameters may now be globally defined for all instantiations by name (@Danack)
- Improved error message when instantiation fails due to (Issue #29) non-public
  constructor method.

v0.10.0
================================================================================

- `Provider::execute()` and `Provider::getExecutable()` now accept string
  arguments for both instance and static class methods e.g.:

```
MyClass::myMethod
MyClass::myStaticMethod
ChildOfMyClass::parent::myStaticMethod
MyClassWithConstructorDependencies::myMethod
```

- Provider::unshare and Provider::refresh now extrapolate class names if passed
  objects instead of strings.
- Miscellaneous bugfixes


#### v0.9.1

- Fixed a bug in ReflectionPool where it would retrieve the incorrect cache
  in some cases (@morrisonlevi)
- Now detects cyclic dependencies and throws an exception before you run out
  of stack or memory (@morrisonlevi)
- Cleaned up error messages in InjectionBuilder and Provider (@morrisonlevi)
- Simplified some behavior in InjectorBuilder, partly for better tooling
  support (@morrisonlevi)
- `Injector::unshare()` now accepts object instances in addition to string
  class names. The class of the passed object is used as the class name to be
  unshared.


v0.9.0
================================================================================
- Added `Injector::getExecutable()` for generating callables from any valid
  PHP callable or [class, method] array with full recursive provisioning and
  the option to get executable versions of protected/private methods.
- Shared aliases are now transparently returned (@Danack)
- Delegate callables now accept parameters (@leight)


#### v0.8.1
- Minor bugfixes

v0.8.0
================================================================================
- Shared concrete class aliases now resolved
- Minor bugfixes

v0.7.0
================================================================================
- Delegates are now automatically provisioned 
- New ProviderBuilder allows for populating injectors from an array, PHP or
  JSON file (@ascii-soup + @rdlowrey)
- Interfaces and abstract classes may now be delegated directly without the
  need for aliasing (@Danack)
- Exceptions thrown by the library have been streamlined


v0.6.0
================================================================================
- Parent definitions are now inherited by child classes (unless overridden)

- Fixed incompatibility with PHP5.3 -- credit: @ascii-soup


v0.5.0
================================================================================
- Added Injector::execute() method for recursively provisioning method
  signatures for all valid PHP callables.
- ReflectionMethod/ReflectionFunction objects are now cached
- Removed superfluous CachingReflectionStorage interface


v0.4.0
================================================================================
- Removed several "meta" methods deemed unnecessary. Simple > complex.


v0.3.0
================================================================================

#### v0.2.1
- Fixed syntax bug that manifested when checking if constructor types were
  instantiable.


v0.2.0
================================================================================
- Added ApcReflectionStorage for high-performance environments
- ReflectionStorage interface change for type-hint retrieval now requires
  the ReflectionMethod along with the ReflectionParameter for improved caching.


v0.1.0
================================================================================
- Initial release
